# Frost Coding Challenge

## Introduction
Welcome! The following code challenge was inspired by some real problems we've tackled recently at Frost. The goal of the assessment is to see how you approach unfamiliar code (as we have been since Frost was acquired in 2022) through the process of refactoring. We're interested in your thoughts, your process, and what you choose to tackle in the allotted time.

If a narrative is helpful, pretend that there is a critical bug in the server, and we've isolated it to this block of code in `main(customer_id)`. We're seeing a combination of data integrity issues and timeouts (the reason for which is yet undetermined) which are happening intermittently. The original code author no longer works with Frost, and you've been tasked with stabilizing the platform. 

## Instructions
- Create a private Github repository, and add `drycode` as a reviewer on the repo.
- Upload the contents of the coding challenge to the main branch of the repository. 
- Checkout a branch (call it whatever you want)
- Perform 30-45 minutes of refactoring on the Repo
- Make small, incremental commits upstream.
- Make a pull request against the main branch and request a review from `drycode`

## A Few Notes
- If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to the person who emailed you this coding challenge. 
- We aren't looking for a runnable solution. In fact, the question is intentionally setup with psuedocode in some places. 
- What we are looking for, is some insight into your engineering process. We think there are opportunities here to address readability, performance, reusability, idiomatic consistency, memory efficiency, and probably many other things; feel free to use some of the time to make notes about future refactoring efforts.
